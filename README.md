Find my latest version [here](https://github.com/CarJem/ManiacEditor/releases/latest), yes, it's still a Beta!

Find the original by **koolkdev** over [there](https://github.com/koolkdev/ManiacEditor/releases/latest), from which this version derives. None of this would be possible without the work done in the original!

Find the fork by **OtherworldBob** over [there](https://github.com/OtherworldBob/ManiacEditor/releases/latest), from which this version also derives from. None of this would be possible without the work done in the fork!
